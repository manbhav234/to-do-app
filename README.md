# to-do-app
Building a todo app using pure HTML, CSS and JS


## Version 0.1

A basic working to-do app. You can create, delete, mark as complete and edit your todos.
Each to-do contains a title, a description and a deadline.
Local storage is implemented to store data regarding todos 

The UI is modest and non-responsive. Will be improved in future versions.
